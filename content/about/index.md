# About Me

I'm Slav, I have a passion for automation. With over 15 years of experience in the IT industry, I specialize in infrastructure as code, containerization, and CI/CD pipelines.

## My Journey

My career began as a System Administrator, where I gained valuable experience managing infrastructure and understanding the challenges of maintaining complex systems. This foundation led me to DevOps, where I found my calling in bridging the gap between development and operations.

Today, I work on implementing SRE principles to deliver reliable, scalable systems. I'm certified in AWS and Terraform, and I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in cloud technologies and automation.

## Outside of Work

When I'm not automating infrastructure, I enjoy canoeing, hiking, spending time with my family, reading books, and exploring new technologies. I'm also passionate about continuous learning and sharing knowledge.
