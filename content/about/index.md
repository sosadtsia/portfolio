# About Me

I'm Slav, I have a passion for automation. With over 15 years of experience in the IT industry, I specialize in infrastructure as code, containerization, and CI/CD pipelines.

## My Journey

My career began as a System Administrator, where I gained valuable experience managing infrastructure and understanding the challenges of maintaining complex systems. This foundation led me to DevOps, where I found my calling in bridging the gap between development and operations.

## Outside of Work

When I'm not automating `things`, I enjoy backcountry canoeing, hiking, spending time with my family, reading books, and exploring new technologies.
